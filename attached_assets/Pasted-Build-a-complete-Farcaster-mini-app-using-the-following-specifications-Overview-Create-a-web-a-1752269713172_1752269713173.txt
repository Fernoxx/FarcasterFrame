Build a complete Farcaster mini app using the following specifications:

🔹 Overview:
Create a web app that lets users enter their Farcaster username and date of birth. When they submit, the app will generate a mystical AI/crypto-themed prediction based on their date of birth. This prediction is secretly based on Indian astrology logic, but should never mention astrology directly. Instead, use cryptic, futuristic language.

🔹 Tech Requirements:
- Pure HTML + JavaScript frontend (in `index.html`)
- A serverless-compatible backend (in `/api/predict.js`) that works on Vercel
- Use Express or standard Node.js export for the backend, but structure it to run on Vercel (i.e., as a serverless function in `api/`)
- Do NOT use any local Express `app.listen(...)` — it should be designed to deploy on Vercel
- Create `package.json` with correct setup and lightweight dependencies if needed
- Ensure this works on Vercel by visiting `/api/predict` after deployment (do not return code or JSON — return an actual rendered HTML response)

🔹 UI Requirements:
- Background color: `#cedce7`
- Text color: `#293958`
- Heading font: "Crimson Pro" from Google Fonts
- Body font: "Figtree" from Google Fonts
- Beautiful, minimal, modern design with good padding and spacing
- Simple centered form:
  - Input for Farcaster Username
  - Input for Date of Birth (dd-mm-yyyy)
  - Submit button: “Reveal My Digital Fate”
- When submitted, it should POST to `/api/predict` and receive a complete HTML page with the prediction

🔹 Frame Requirements:
- The HTML returned by `/api/predict` should include:
  - `<meta name="fc:frame" content="vNext" />`
  - `<meta name="fc:frame:image" content="..." />` — Use a generated dummy image with prediction text (you can use https://dummyimage.com or generate simple SVG with the prediction)
  - `<meta name="fc:frame:button:1" content="Reveal Again" />`
  - `<meta name="fc:frame:post_url" content="https://your-vercel-deployment.vercel.app/api/predict" />` — replace with current domain automatically

🔹 Prediction Logic:
- Use the user’s date of birth to map into one of 12 cryptic "tech-zodiac" signs based loosely on Indian zodiac mapping (but keep it hidden).
- Generate a mystical message that sounds like:
  > “The Neural Tide aligns with Protocol Gemini. By 2032, a self-learning token may choose your voice as its oracle. Watch the 8th lunar cycle.”

- Include symbols like 🤖 🧠 💰 🪙 ✨ sparingly
- Never mention "astrology", "zodiac", "stars", or anything directly traditional
- Make each prediction seem personalized and futuristic

🔹 Final Structure:
- `/index.html` — main form UI
- `/api/predict.js` — backend response with prediction
- `/package.json` — minimal dependencies if needed

🔹 Deployment Compatibility:
- Ensure it works when pushed to GitHub and deployed to Vercel.
- When deployed, visiting `/api/predict` directly should return an HTML response (not raw code, not 500 error)
- Ensure headers are set correctly: `Content-Type: text/html`

Do not require the user to input manually any texts or choose options. Entire prediction logic must be auto-generated.

Return the full file structure with content of each file ready to copy-paste into Replit. Also ensure it runs properly without modification after deploying on Vercel.
